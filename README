# About

  This is written for my comfort when starting a new project. Included files
  cover basic front-end stuff like: basic html5 layout, css reset, common js
  libs. The usage of tags and code is referenced and commented (files stripped
  from refs and comments are also available).

  If you need something more robust and dynamic, check out HTML5 Boilerplate
  project: https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate
